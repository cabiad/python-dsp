python-dsp
==========

A short introduction to DSP in Python, with an emphasis on audio processing and visualization. Contains a Keynote presentation and 3 iPython notebooks (intended to by used with pylab --inline mode).

Created for an OANDA lunch and learn session.

Deeply inspired and influenced by the excellent PyCon 2013 DSP tutorial given by Mel Chua (https://github.com/mchua/pycon-sigproc)
